I'm Fabian, I make software and games and stuff.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on

### My website (finally)

I was looking into building my own website for some time now. Initially as a portfolio for my game dev stuff. When I tanked that idea I wanted one just as a normal coding portfolio for getting a job. 

Now I got a job without having to show a fancy portfolio and I'm just ding it for the sake of having a website.

It's currently [very rough](https://salzian.de) and I'll open source it once it actually is worth showing it. Or never when React has finally broken my last bit of sanity.

### Alternate Universe  
  
Alternate Universe is a FiveM server that I revived out of the ashes of a nasty revenge spree. It's containing multiple small project's like a Discord bot, a status page and the server software itself.

### Lazerena  
  
> Lazerena is a battle racer set in a cyberpunk neon world. You play on an arena map battling each other 5v5 with different vehicle classes while collecting different power-ups to enhance your weapons.  

I've been working on this project on and off since I started making games. Right now I'm rebuilding it in Unreal Engine.

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning

- Kotlin for work
- React to get more familiar with frontend work
- Unreal Engine for fun

### Unity game engine
    
I've worked with Unity during my studies on hobby, university and even a commercial project. i got quite a glimpse of this beast and can get you started learning how to make games. I'm no professioal though ðŸ˜…
