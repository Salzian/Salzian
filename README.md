# Henlo 👋

I'm Fabian, I make software and games and stuffs.

## What I usually work on

### trivago

After my internship, I was lucky to be offered a position as a backend engineer at trivago. There, I now work on a network of microservices for aggregating and delivering data. Everything is built with Kotlin, a language I had to learn from scratch when I started there. Quite the experience with my limited toolset of student knowledge. But also quite the beautiful language 😍

### Game Development

Currently completely paused. I made games for the past 2+ years and burned out pretty hard on them. Working in the confines of a game engine / framework is not always the most rewarding development cycle. And building your own engine? Ain't nobody got time for that!

### Alternate Universe

Alternate Universe is a [FiveM](https://fivem.net) freeroam server. I built most of the tools and plugins there. I since decided to step down as the main dev due to the ever increasing work load in a very limited time capacity. I still support the operations of the project and work on some experimental features, but now with a more recreational-oriented time management.

### Web

I learned Angular in uni, but it was too bloaty for me to make some simple projects. I then focused on React, but really understanding TSX is not easy.

Recently I got introduced to Svelte, but that's still a lot of Voodoo magic to me. Let's see where that journey goes...

### Misc

I tried to learn some Rust, but the syntax was kinda weird. Still gonna try it at a later date tho, just not in the mood right now.

### Unity game engine
    
I've worked with Unity during my studies on hobby, university and even a commercial project. I got quite a glimpse of this beast and can get you started learning how to make games. I'm no professional though 😅
